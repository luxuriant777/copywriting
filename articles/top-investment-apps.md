### The Top Investment Apps for Beginner Investors

As a beginner investor, it can be overwhelming to navigate the world of investing and figure out where to start. One of the easiest and most convenient ways to get started is through the use of investment apps. These apps allow you to manage your investments, track your portfolio, and make trades all from the convenience of your smartphone. In this article, we will discuss the top investment apps for beginner investors.

1. Acorns - Acorns is a great investment app for beginners because it allows you to start investing with as little as $5. The app rounds up your purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the spare change for you. It also offers a variety of investment portfolios to choose from, based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. Robinhood - Robinhood is a popular investment app that allows you to buy and sell stocks, options, and cryptocurrency commission-free. It also offers educational resources and market news to help you make informed investment decisions. One downside to Robinhood is that it does not offer retirement accounts, so it may not be the best option for long-term investing.

3. Stash - Stash is another app that is great for beginner investors. It has a low minimum investment amount of $1 and offers a variety of investment options, including stocks, ETFs, and even fractional shares. Stash also offers educational resources and has a feature called "Stash Learn" that provides information on various investment topics.

4. Betterment - Betterment is a robo-advisor that offers a variety of investment portfolios based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. It also offers retirement accounts and has a feature called "Betterment Goal Tracker" that helps you set and track your financial goals. One downside to Betterment is that it does have a higher minimum investment amount of $100.

5. Wealthfront - Wealthfront is another popular robo-advisor that offers a variety of investment portfolios based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. It also offers educational resources and has a feature called "Path" that helps you track your progress towards your financial goals. Like Betterment, Wealthfront does have a higher minimum investment amount of $500.

Investment apps can be a convenient and easy way for beginner investors to get started in the world of investing. Whether you're looking for a hands-off approach with a robo-advisor or a more active approach with the ability to buy and sell individual stocks, there is an investment app out there for you. It's important to do your research and choose an app that aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. With the right investment app, you can start taking control of your financial future and building your investment portfolio.
